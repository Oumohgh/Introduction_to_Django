# ðŸ“š LibraryProject

This is my very first Django project, created as part of my journey in the ALX BackEnd program.  
Itâ€™s a basic setup to explore how Django works, starting from scratch: installing it, creating a project, and running the server successfully.

The goal here is to get comfortable with the Django project structure and understand the role of key files like `settings.py`, `urls.py`, and `manage.py`.
